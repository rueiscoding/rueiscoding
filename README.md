## Hi, I'm Rue

I’m a developer exploring the intersection of code and meaning.

Right now, I’m building **Lacunae**, a project that blends ancient Greek, transformer-based NLP, and interface design to find meaning within lost and fragmented texts.

I’m open to collaborating, whether or not you have a tech background. Much of my work plays with speculative design, language, experimental storytelling... there’s always more to learn and I’m looking to learn from people like you :)
