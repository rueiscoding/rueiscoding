## Hi, I'm Rue

I’m a developer exploring the intersection of code and meaning -- through data, design, and a bit of imagination.

Right now, I’m building **Lacunae**, a project that blends ancient Greek, transformer-based NLP, and interface design to find meaning within lost and fragmented texts.

I’m open to collaboration, whether you're coming from tech, the arts, or somewhere in between. Much of my work plays with speculative design, language, experimental storytelling…there’s always more to learn and I’m looking to learn from people like you :)
